1.There are three data types in Python that are of interest to us at the moment: integers, floats (fractional numbers written with a decimal point, like 1.970), and booleans (which can be True or False).
Never use quotation marks (' or ") with booleans
2.Python is case-sensitive 
#my_bool=True ===>  注意大小写
3.change the value
。。。。
my_int=7
...
my_int=3
...
print my_int  ====> 3
4.whitespace
To continue the sentence analogy, it's clear that we also need a kind of punctuation to make it obvious where one statement ends and another begins. If you're familiar with JavaScript, you know that statements end with a semicolon (;). In Python, statements are separated by whitespace
5.whitespace means right space
